		<h2> First tab </h2>

There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author, and the three
form a rising scale of compliment: 1, to tell him you have read
one of his books; 2, to tell him you have read all of his books; 3,
to ask him to let you read the manuscript of his forthcoming book.
No. 1 admits you to his respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration;
No. 3 carries you clear into his heart.
		-- Mark Twain, "Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar"

		<h2> Third tab </h2>
Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of
fear.  Except a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to
say it is brave; it is merely a loose misapplication of the word.
Consider the flea!--incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of
God, if ignorance of fear were courage.  Whether you are asleep or
awake he will attack you, caring nothing for the fact that in bulk
and strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the earth
to a sucking child; he lives both day and night and all days and
nights in the very lap of peril and the immediate presence of death,
and yet is no more afraid than is the man who walks the streets of
a city that was threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before.
When we speak of Clive, Nelson, and Putnam as men who "didn't know
what fear was," we ought always to add the flea--and put him at the
head of the procession.

		<h2> Fourth tab </h2>
Do not overtax your powers.

"I wonder", he said to himself, "what's in a book while it's closed.
Oh, I know it's full of letters printed on paper, but all the same,
something must be happening, because as soon as I open it, there's a
whole story with people I don't know yet and all kinds of adventures
and battles."
		-- Bastian B. Bux
